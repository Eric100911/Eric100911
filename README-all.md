üå± I am Chi Wang, an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, majoring in Physics.

> Ugh... A short remark about my name. In Chinese, we usually put the family name first, so I am called "ÁéãÈ©∞(W√°ng Ch√≠, more strictly written in pinyin with tone marks)".
>
> Pronuouncing "Chi" is a bit tricky. It is like the "chi" in "chicken", but with a shorter "i" sound. The tone matters in Chinese. Luckily, two characters in my name have the same tone of the second tone. Just remember to make the second syllable sound like a question, and you will be fine.
>
> If you are asking for a more accurrate pronunciation, I wouldn't say I am familiar with the IPA stuff. Perhaps I'll consult some linguists or Chinese major students to help me with that.
>
> Before that, well...Suppose you are not familiar with Chinese names nor IPA, you can just call me "Eric", as my GitHub username suggests. My sister gave me this English name when I was 6, and I have been using it since then.
>
> As for the 6 digits in my username... It came from my days in primary school. This little kid stepped into Nanpu Primary School, Wenzhou(Ê∏©Â∑ûÂ∏ÇÂçóÊµ¶Â∞èÂ≠¶) in 2010, and he was assigned to Class 9, with the student number 11 in the class. Information technology became one of the courses since Grade 3, and the teacher gave us IDs for assignments. The teacher gave me this catchy ID "100911", and I have been using it as my username in many places since then.

üéá I am interested in high energy physics experiments, currently working on the CMS experiment at LHC, CERN under supervision of [Prof. Zhen HuÔºàËÉ°ÈúáÔºâ](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1097/4462.htm).

> Same remark with the name again. Except that "Zh√®nÔºàÈúáÔºâ" has a different tone from "H√∫ÔºàËÉ°Ôºâ". The former is in the fourth tone, which is dropping down. The tone is somewhat consistent with the literal meaning of the character, a firm and strong shake. The same character is used in the word "earthquake" in Chinese, "Âú∞ÈúáÔºàd√¨ zh√®nÔºâ".

üî≠ I am working on some B-physics analyses, mainly searching for simultaneous production of multiple heavy-flavor quarkonia in proton-proton collisions, using Run 3 data.

> Feel free to checkout my analysis code in my repositories such as [TPS-Onia2MuMu](https://github.com/Eric100911/TPS-Onia2MuMu), [ParticleCand](https://github.com/Eric100911/ParticleCand), and [JpsiUpsPhi-workspace](https://github.com/Eric100911/JpsiUpsPhi-workspace). They might not be that elegent, but I managed to do some encapsulation and documentation. Hope you like them.
>
> They are, in one way, like my baby.

ü§ñ I am also interested in software development, with much experience in Python, C++, and ROOT.

> I am also using some other tools such as `sed`, `GNU Make` and `bash` scripts. I leared to use them when I was on a summer course in Tsinghua and have started to combine them to build some useful tools. 
>
> Make sure to check out [JpsiUpsPhi-workspace](https://github.com/Eric100911/JpsiUpsPhi-workspace). I used `GNU Make` in a way that squeezes out quite some potential of the machines with multithreading. 

üìù A copy of [my Curricular Vitae](CV-chiwang.pdf) is available in this repository. It should be updated regularly, but in case it is not, please feel free to contact me at `chi.w@cern.ch` for the latest version.

> If you are some kind of geek, also feel free to check out the LaTeX source code of my CV in the repository [resume](https://github.com/Eric100911/resume). Trust me, it will always be my lastest public version. So if you would like to get a new version of my CV, feel free to clone the repository and compile it yourself.
> 
> Up to this point, I am still compiling the CV in LaTeX on Overleaf and exporting it to PDF, given the limited storage on my computer and the humonguous size required by those compilers, as far as I can see.
> 
> I am considering to use some more automated tools to generate the CV, such as introducing some CI/CD pipelines to automatically compile the CV and push the PDF to the repository. Perhaps in a week or two I will have the thing ready. Stay tuned!
>
> Speaking of CV and CI/CD, you might have noticed that I am participating in the [CMS Tier-0 Software](https://github.com/dmwm/t0) development. My job now is reconstructing a CI/CD workflow for the software, using Github Webhook and CMS Jenkins, with the help of @cmsbot . I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Jan Eysermans](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1417176) (@jeyserma on GitHub).

üßê As of now (Mar. 2025), I am still exploring PhD position possibilities in experimental high energy physics starting from Fall 2026. If you are interested in my profile, please feel free to contact me at my email.
