- 🌱 I am Chi Wang, an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, majoring in Physics. You can also just call me "Eric", as my GitHub user name suggests.
- 🎇 I am interested in high energy physics experiments, currently working on the CMS experiment at LHC, CERN under supervision of [Prof. Zhen Hu（胡震）](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1097/4462.htm).
- 🔭 I am working on some B-physics analyses, mainly searching for simultaneous production of multiple heavy-flavor quarkonia in proton-proton collisions, using Run 3 data.
- 🤖 I am also interested in software development, with much experience in Python, C++, and ROOT.
- 📝 A copy of [my Curricular Vitae](CV-chiwang.pdf) is available in this repository. It should be updated regularly, but in case it is not, please feel free to contact me at [`chi.w@cern.ch`](chi.w@cern.ch) for the latest version.
- 🧐 As of now (Mar. 2025), I am still exploring PhD position possibilities in experimental high energy physics starting from Fall 2026. If you are interested in my profile, please feel free to contact me at my email.
