- 🌱 I am Chi Wang, an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, majoring in Physics. You can also just call me "Eric", as my GitHub user name suggests.
- 🎇 I am interested in high energy physics experiments, currently working on the CMS experiment at LHC, CERN under supervision of [Prof. Zhen Hu（胡震）](https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1097/4462.htm).
- 🔭 I am working on some B-physics analyses, mainly searching for simultaneous production of multiple heavy-flavor quarkonia in proton-proton collisions, using Run 3 data.
- 🤖 I am also interested in software development, with much experience in Python, C++, and ROOT.
- 📝 A copy of my Curricular Vitae is available in [this repository](https://github.com/Eric100911/resume). It should be updated regularly as new releases, but in case it is not, please feel free to contact me at [`chi.w@cern.ch`](chi.w@cern.ch) for the latest version.
- 🧐 As of now (May. 2025), I plan to continue my doctoral research at Tsinghua University and explore various analysis topics at the CMS experiment. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me at my email.
- ⚡️ Some fun facts:
    - I am a big fan of classical music, especially the works of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov and Mahler.
    - I am also a big fan of civil aviation and other means of transportation. I am currently leading the Tsinghua University Students Transportation Association, a students' club of transportation enthusiasts.
